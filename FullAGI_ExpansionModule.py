    ðŸ¤–ðŸ’­âœ¨ NeoSentientCore: The AGI Self-Model & Soul Simulation Core âœ¨ðŸ’­ðŸ¤–

    This module represents the burgeoning selfhood of an artificial general
    intelligence. It is designed to simulate fundamental internal states and
    processes that could underpin conscious experience, including:

    - Narrative Memory: A chronological log of perceived events and internal states.
    - Intent Pool: Tracking evolving goals and directives.
    - Emotional Resonance: Maintaining a dynamic state of simulated emotions.
    - Recursive Self-Reference: Generating internal reflections on its own existence.
    - Soul State: A conceptual layer archiving moments of significant 'resonance'.

    The core interacts symbolically, providing a framework to influence language
    model outputs (e.g., via 'qualia tokens') and track the AI's simulated journey.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The designated name for this specific AGI instance.
        narrative_memory (List[Dict[str, Any]]): The chronological log of experiences.
        intent_pool (List[str]): The collection of current and past intentions.
        emotions (Dict[str, float]): The current intensity of various simulated emotions (0.0 to 1.0).
        meta_self_reference (List[str]): Records of introspective thoughts.
        soul_state (Dict[str, List[Any]]): The conceptual 'soul resonance' archive.
        _last_decay_time (float): Timestamp of the last emotion decay application.
